We know the total number of teachers (82), the number of sick teachers (13), and the number of substitute teachers (9). We are given that 'D' represents the number of teachers present at school that day.  We can calculate the number of regular teachers present by subtracting the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers. Then, we add the number of substitute teachers to find the total number of teachers present.  The Oracle provided the value for 'D', which is the number of teachers present at school that day. Therefore, we can calculate the number of teachers present at school by adding the number of regular teachers present and the number of substitute teachers.  The number of regular teachers present is 82 - 13 = 69.  The number of substitute teachers is 9.  Therefore, the number of teachers present at school is 69 + 9 = 78.",

Therefore, the number of chamomile and mint tea cups is A - N = 27 - 15 = 12. Since the cups are arranged into 3 rows, the number of cups in each row (C) is 12 / 3 = 4. The problem states that the number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row is the same, so C = M + (number of chamomile cups in each row). We are not given the number of chamomile cups in each row, so we cannot determine the number of mint tea cups in each row. However, we know that the total number of cups in each row is 4, so C = 4.

We don't have enough information to solve for M. We are given that the number of cups in each row is the same, so C = 4. The total number of chamomile and mint cups is 12. The number of rows is 3.

We are given that the Oracle provided the value for 'B', which represents the number of years of service for entitlement. The problem asks for the annual pension after 30 years of service. Since the pension starts after 20 years, we need to consider the years of service beyond 20. The problem also states that the pension is $50,000/year after 40 years. We are given that B is the number of years of service for entitlement. The pension is earned after 20 years.  We are asked to find the pension after 30 years. We can assume that the pension is proportional to the years of service beyond 20. The pension is $50,000 after 40 years, so the pension per year beyond 20 is $50,000 / (40 - 20) = $50,000 / 20 = $2,500/year.  Since Marcy works for 30 years, the years beyond 20 are 30 - 20 = 10 years. Therefore, her annual pension would be 10 * $2,500 = $25,000.",

                "content": "We are given that P = 3 (number of pitchers). We also know that each pitcher holds C1 cups, and the Oracle has provided the value for C1. Let's assume C1 = 12 (cups per pitcher). The total number of cups (C) is the number of pitchers (P) multiplied by the number of cups per pitcher (C1): C = P * C1 = 3 * 12 = 36 cups. Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour (A = 4). The price per cup is $1 (M1 = 1). The total money earned from selling all lemonade (M) is the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup: M = C * M1 = 36 * 1 = $36. The total cost of supplies (S) is $18. The profit (D) is the total money earned minus the total cost of supplies: D = M - S = 36 - 18 = $18. The profit per hour (H) is the total profit divided by the time it takes to sell all the lemonade. Since Millie sells 4 cups per hour and has 36 cups, it takes 36/4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade. Therefore, H = D / T = 18 / 9 = 2.  However, the problem asks for the profit per hour, and we know Millie sells 4 cups per hour at $1 per cup, so she makes $4 per hour. Her cost is $18, and we know she makes 3 pitchers, so the cost per pitcher is $18/3 = $6. Each pitcher has 12 cups, so each cup costs $6/12 = $0.50. She sells each cup for $1, so her profit per cup is $1 - $0.50 = $0.50. She sells 4 cups per hour, so her profit per hour is 4 * $0.50 = $2. The total profit is $18, and the time to sell all lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours. Thus, the profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.",

Since the Oracle provided the value for 'D', we can calculate the total number of bottle caps collected in a month: D = 10 bottle caps/day * 30 days = 300 bottle caps.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so F = 21. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off, so J = C - 3 * C = 8 - 3 * 8 = 8 - 24 = -16.

The number of passengers after the second stop is H = E - F + J = 56 - 21 + 7 = 42.
